Connect another wire to the GND pin on the uno and the "-" of the breadboard.

Connect the positive side of the buzzer to the digital pin 2 of the Arduino Uno.

Connect the negative side of the buzzer to the "-" on the breadboard.

Connect the Vcc terminal of thed ultrasonic sensor to "+" on the breadboard.

Connect the GND of the sensor to the "-" on the breadboard.

Connect the trig pin to digital pin 10 on Arduino.
